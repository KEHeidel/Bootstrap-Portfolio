        <p>
          I was born in Tennessee but grew up in Florida. While in High School I
          was active in soccer, cross country, track and field, color guard,
          orchestra, and several other activities. I attended college at Flordia
          Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers where I majored in Biology; after
          a year I moved back to Tennessee to be closer to family. Six years
          later I married my wonderful husband Josh and we have four obnoxiously
          amazing fur babies: Mollie, Shiloh, Ranger, and Erza.

          I got into coding because of a love for computers and all things
          technology. I have been doing simple coding work on my own for a few
          years on and off. I really am looking forward to honing my skills and
          learning additional things durning this coding bootcamp.
